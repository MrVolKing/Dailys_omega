                        p Research shows that 90% of the population has an Omega-3 shortage. So we don’t have to enter that discussion. The real question is: Why do people still gain it out of fish, while the fish themselves get it from algae? 
                        p Our sole purpose is to replace all fish oil by plant based algae oil. Why? So everybody can leave the fish alone and still get a pure, clean dose of Omega-3! Better for you and better for the ocean!

                    .sect5__descblock
                        p In 2018, a bright group of students discovered a very special Algae in the mangrove forest. Because of the leaves falling onto the water, the nutritions floated down and made a type of Algae, which is very rich of omega 3.
                        p Many years later, this process is still being recreated on a large scale. The mangrove is being replaced with big stainless steel cattles and the leaves with smart nutritions. But the principle is the same, in a European patterned process. 
                        p We don’t need to explain that taking a huge diesel consuming ship with big fish nets on the coast of Peru (where they fish the anchovies) and squeeze the oil out of the fish is a very controlled process. Especially when you know that fish are (unfortunately) full of PCB’s and other toxins. This is why all the fish oil producers are so proud that they have found at least seven filtering processes to make sure they have filtered out all the toxins and PCB’s. So they then offer a product with which they are proud of how they managed to filter out the toxin… Wow, good for them! 
                        p With our controlled algae production we don’t have to filter out the toxins and PCB’s. Just for a simple reason: There are none. So there’s no need to filter and clean the oil endlessly. This results in a very clean oil with a very low totox value.
